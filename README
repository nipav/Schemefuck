A brainfuck interpreter implemented in Guile Scheme.

BRAINFUCK OPERATORS

  > Increment the pointer.
  < Decrement the pointer.
  + Increment the byte at the pointer.
  - Decrement the byte at the pointer.
  . Output the byte at the pointer.
  , Input a byte and store it in the byte at the pointer.
  [ Jump forward past the matching ] if the byte at the pointer is zero.
  ] Jump backward to the matching [ unless the byte at the pointer is zero.

Note: the looping operators [ and ] have not been implemented yet.
You can still write brainfuck programs, but it's a bit more annoying.
